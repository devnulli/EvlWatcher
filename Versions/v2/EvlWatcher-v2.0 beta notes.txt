- should fix the ram usage problem of the previous versions
- should fix issues with not banning Event 4625
- fixes a security issue on the named pipe
- the console was revamped

How to test the beta 1:

- Install EvlWatcher
	- there should be no need to install previous versions, it will be replaced. if that doesnt work, please report that in the pull request

- once check if it runs stable, leave it running for a few days, to find out if it still uses massive amounts of RAM over the time.

- Evlwatcher should still recognize IPs out the event log, according to config.xml
	- if there are any adjustments to be made to these rules, also let me know please.

- Try out the console. During that pull request, (going until nov 2020) some features will be added and new versions made, including
	- Live Output from the service will be displayed
	- Task configuration and rule tester

- Stay tuned on the pull request to find out when new versions have been put up.


Thanks to all. Especially to shimuldn and NukeDev for helping me out with testing and developing that.

Mike.
