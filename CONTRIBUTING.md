# Contribution

If there is anything you can contribute, PLEASE do so, for whatever reason (specific issue, code smells, whatever). 
Just make a pull request, and request it to be merged. If there are any issues you resolve with the pull request, make sure to link to them.

Every once in a while, all the merged stuff will be put to the test and finally become a new version. 
(depending on what has changed, that can be more or less frequent. Weeks, YEARS, DECADES, MILLENIA, or never)

## Seriously, before you start coding, please keep the following things in mind:

- When creating a pull request that solves issues, its a good idea to discuss the change you wish to make in the issue thread.
- When just improving or refactoring the code, its generally also a good idea to discuss it first. 
- OR you just go on and code, pull request, and see what happens. Worst thing to happen is: that you invest a huge lot of work into unwanted changes.

## Happiness is when decent coders help out, and good people test that thing.

I (devnulli) dont even have a Windows Server anymore. So if anyone helps out keeping this up to date, or testing it. mucho gusto! THANKS
