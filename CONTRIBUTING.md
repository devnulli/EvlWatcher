# Contribution

If there is anything you can contribute, PLEASE do so, for whatever reason (specific issue, code smells, whatever). 
Just make a pull request, and request it to be merged. If there are any issues you resolve with the pull request, make sure to link to them.

## Making a pull request.
There is always branch for version that is currently up next (for example "v2.1.3" ). When you make a pull request, please let it base on that branch, never on master.
Thats all.

Every once in a while, all the things in the new version branch will be put to the test and finally become a new release.
(depending on what has changed, that can be more or less frequent. Weeks, YEARS, DECADES, MILLENIA, or never)

## Before you start coding, please keep the following things in mind:

- When creating a pull request that solves issues, its a good idea to discuss the change you wish to make in the issue thread.
- When just improving or refactoring the code, its generally also a good idea to discuss it first. 
- OR you just go on and code, pull request, and see what happens. For small changes thats ok. The bigger your time investment, the more important is that you discuss it first.

## Happiness is when decent coders help out, and good people test that thing.

I (devnulli) dont even have a Windows Server anymore. So if anyone helps out keeping this up to date, or testing it. mucho gusto! THANKS
