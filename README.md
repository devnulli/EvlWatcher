# Sooo. Damn you CoVid-19 ... Announcing a beta release of the new version (v2.0 beta) for ~~2020-07-01~~ 2020-12-01

So, this is about time this thing gets new paint applied.
After I almost abandoned this, I got a lot of questions when and how a new release of this "beauty" will be done.

So finally, during ~~May and June~~ October and November, I will rewrite EvlWatcher. I can't promise that all of the features will be in it, but the plan is that the following things be implemented to it during the course of this remake:

Coming up:

- Fix some security issues with the configuration app. 

- Fix some problems with ram usage

- Improve the console app and configuration options (including logging)

- Add a Repo description (i.e. a cool documentation an what not), and add community guidelines, to finally make it easier for others to contribute. 

- Do some necessary SE-stuff, like refactor it to SOLID, unit testing, etc.

- Do some maintenance like shifting it up to .Net Version 4.7.2, which is now default for Windows Servers

- And finally, revamp the configuration App and the Installer.

Not in this upcoming version:

- Better Tasks (collate, scriptable,...)

- set up some Github CI for EvlWatcher

- automatic updates and what not

# Testers needed.

Since I personally no longer expose my Windows Servers to the Web, I would also need testers to try out certain things.
If you wanna test that thing, please contact me.
