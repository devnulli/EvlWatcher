EvlWatcher v2.1.3 release notes.
----------------------------------

- a negative perma-ban setting means that perma banning is disabled 
- whitelisted ips will - though they are not really banned - no longer show up in the temp ban list of the console
- there is now a button that will add all temporary bans to the permanent ban list 
- will now protect openssh out of the box
- fixed a potential security issue 
- tasks that rely on log sources that are not present are now disabled, instead of throwing an error on every iteration (30 secs default)
